### A Swift 5 iOS app showcasing SwiftUI and JSON decoding

This app was made for a coding challenge over the course of a week part-time (about 15 hours). 

It pulls JSON data from the API listed here:
[https://edan.si.edu/openaccess/apidocs/#api-search-category_search](https://edan.si.edu/openaccess/apidocs/#api-search-category_search)

The app demonstrates how to create a search bar and maintain state with other controls (pickerView and 'next', 'previous' buttons). It also demonstrates how to parse nested elements from JSON using 'nestedContainers'.
